# Dragon Repeller - JavaScript RPG game

## Description
My motivation was to use my JavaScript skills to create a simple RPG game.
I built this project so that I can practice my JavaScript skills and challenge myself.
It's a very enjoyable gaming experience with a lot of interactivity from the users part and a lot of entertaining elements such as a custom theme song I created a while ago for a musical project I used to run called Pitchpilot, a custom video background and SFX for all interactive components of the game.
I learned how to integrate sound, background music and video backgrounds to make an entertaining game.
What makes my project stand out is that it uses a lot of entertaining elements users have come to expect out of a game.
